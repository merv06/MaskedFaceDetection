# MaskedFaceDetection
COMM417DA Machine Learning Coursework
Overview

This project implements a masked-face detection model using Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50-FPN backbone in PyTorch. It detects three mask-related classes: with_mask, without_mask, and mask_weared_incorrect.

## Reproducibility
All code and experiments are tracked in this repository. See the experimental logs and saved checkpoints under /checkpoints.
