# MaskedFaceDetection
COMM417DA Machine Learning Coursework
Overview

This project implements a masked-face detection model using Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50-FPN backbone in PyTorch. It detects three mask-related classes: with_mask, without_mask, and mask_weared_incorrect.

### Reproducibility
All code and experiments are tracked in this repository. See the experimental logs and saved checkpoints under /checkpoints.

### Usage
Clone the repository (private):
git clone git@github.com:your_org/MaskedFaceDetection.git
cd MaskedFace-Detection

### Install dependencies:
pip install torch torchvision numpy pandas pillow

### Download and Run Jupyter Notebook
This will be provided at a later date after the coureswork has been marked. As of this commit, this repository will only have the checkpoint files. 

### License & Privacy
